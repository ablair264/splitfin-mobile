# Splitfin TSX & CSS Component Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. CustomerLayout Sidebar Badge Positioning
**Problem**: Badges inside sidebar icon containers were being cut off due to `overflow: hidden` on parent elements.

**Solution**:
- Changed `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: visible` on `.sidebar-icon-btn` and `.notification-bell` elements
- Adjusted badge positioning from `top: -4px` to `top: -5px` for better visibility
- Added box-shadow with sidebar background color to create visual separation
- Added `z-index: 10` to ensure badges appear above other elements

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/CustomerLayout/CustomerSidebar.css`

### 2. MessagingContext Chat Window Improvements
**Problem**: 
- Messages weren't being received in real-time between users
- Chat window used dark theme colors inconsistent with customer portal design

**Solutions**:
- Created separate customer-themed CSS file for messaging when used in customer portal
- Added real-time message update events using custom browser events
- Implemented dynamic theme switching based on user type (customer vs admin)
- Added event listeners for real-time message synchronization

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/contexts/MessagingContext.tsx`
- Created: `/src/contexts/messaging-customer.css`

**Key Changes**:
- Added `isCustomerView` state to detect if current user is a customer
- Applied `customer-msg-popup` class when in customer view
- Created custom event `messageUpdate` to notify components of new messages
- Styled customer messaging with brand colors and gradients matching the portal theme

### 3. CustomerCheckout Layout Optimization
**Problem**:
- Checkout page was too large with excessive scrolling
- White text on white background in total-row making it unreadable
- Input fields missing borders when not focused
- Delivery notes textarea had black background
- Overall spacing was too generous

**Solutions**:
- Reduced padding and margins throughout the component for more compact layout
- Fixed text color issues by properly scoping color styles to span elements
- Changed input border color from transparent `#f5f3f4` to visible `#e5e5e5`
- Set proper background colors for all form inputs and textareas
- Reduced font sizes slightly for better information density
- Decreased section padding and gaps between elements

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/CustomerCheckout/CustomerCheckout.css`

**Specific Changes**:
- Main padding: `0 2rem 2rem` → `1rem 2rem`
- Header margin: `3rem` → `1.5rem`
- Section padding: `2rem` → `1.5rem`
- Border radius: `16px` → `12px` for consistency
- Font sizes reduced by ~20% across headers
- Fixed `.total-row span` color inheritance
- Set all inputs to have `background: #ffffff` and visible borders

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Sidebar Badges**: 
   - Verify badges display correctly on cart, messages, and notifications icons
   - Test with different badge numbers (single and double digits)
   - Check badge animation still works properly

2. **Messaging**:
   - Test messaging between customer and brand manager accounts
   - Verify real-time message delivery
   - Check that customer theme applies correctly in customer portal
   - Test message notifications and unread counts

3. **Checkout**:
   - Verify all text is readable (especially in order totals)
   - Test form inputs focus states and borders
   - Ensure delivery notes textarea displays correctly
   - Check responsive behavior on mobile devices
   - Verify the page fits better on standard screen sizes

## Additional Notes:

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- CSS custom properties are used consistently for theming
- Animations and transitions are preserved
- Mobile responsiveness is maintained
- No breaking changes to component functionality
