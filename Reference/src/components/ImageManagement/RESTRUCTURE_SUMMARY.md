# Image Management Restructuring - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Navigation Structure Update** - `MasterLayout.tsx`
- Added "Image Management" as a top-level section in the sidebar
- Created brand-specific routes: `/images/:brandId`
- Added "All Images" option and individual brand options in the dropdown
- Images are now fetched per-brand instead of loading all and filtering client-side

### 2. **Routing Updates** - `main.tsx`
- Added new routes:
  - `/images` - Shows all images across brands
  - `/images/:brandId` - Shows images for specific brand only
- Removed old `/inventory/images` route

### 3. **ImageManagement Component Updates**
- Now accepts `brandId` from route parameters
- Removed client-side brand filtering (now done server-side)
- Brand pills now navigate to brand-specific routes instead of filtering
- Upload modal pre-selects brand when on brand-specific page
- Updated header to show brand name when viewing specific brand

### 4. **useImageKit Hook Updates**
- Added `brandId` option to fetch from specific brand folder
- Cache keys are now brand-specific (e.g., `brand-images-blomus`)
- Server requests include brand-specific folder path
- Optimized to only fetch images for selected brand

### 5. **Upload Modal Updates**
- Accepts `defaultBrand` prop
- Hides brand selector when only one brand is available
- Pre-selects brand when uploading from brand-specific page

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Only loads images for selected brand instead of all images
2. **Scalability**: Better handles large numbers of images per brand
3. **User Experience**: Cleaner navigation with brand-specific pages
4. **Cache Efficiency**: Brand-specific caching reduces memory usage

## Usage

- Navigate to `/images` to see all images
- Navigate to `/images/blomus` to see only Blomus images
- Use sidebar dropdown under "Image Management" to switch between brands
- Images are cached per-brand for faster subsequent loads
