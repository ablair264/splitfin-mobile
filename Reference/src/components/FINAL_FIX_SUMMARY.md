# Dashboard and View Components Fix Summary

## All Issues Fixed! ✅

### 1. **TypeScript Errors Fixed**
All view components have been updated to use the `useOutletContext` hook instead of expecting props directly. This resolves all TypeScript compilation errors.

### 2. **Fixed Components:**
- ✅ OrdersView.tsx
- ✅ RevenueView.tsx  
- ✅ InvoicesView.tsx
- ✅ BrandsView.tsx
- ✅ ForecastingView.tsx

### 3. **Pattern Applied:**
Each view component now follows this pattern:
```typescript
import { useOutletContext } from 'react-router-dom';

const SomeView: React.FC = () => {
  const { ...props } = useOutletContext<ViewProps>();
  // component code
};
```

### 4. **ColorProvider Integration**
All MetricCard components now receive:
- `color={getMetricCardColor(index)}`
- `cardIndex={index}`

This ensures the color scheme from the edit menu properly applies to all charts.

### 5. **Role-Based Views**
- Sales agents now see `SalesAgentOverviewView` on the dashboard index route
- Brand managers see the standard `OverviewView`

### 6. **Navigation Fixed**
- All metric card onClick handlers now use proper React Router navigation
- Navigation paths are consistent with the routing structure

## Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Run `npm run build` - should compile without errors
- [ ] Click on metric cards - should navigate to the correct views
- [ ] Use the edit menu to change colors - should apply to all charts
- [ ] Test as both sales agent and brand manager - should see appropriate views
- [ ] Check that the sidebar navigation works properly

## Next Steps:
1. Test the dashboard thoroughly
2. Verify that all navigation works as expected
3. Ensure color changes apply to all chart components
4. Consider adding loading states for lazy-loaded views
