## Summary of Fixed Issues

### 1. Import Path Corrections
- Fixed all import paths from `../../` to `../` in both BrandManagerDashboard.tsx and SalesAgentDashboard.tsx
- Updated imports for:
  - `useDashboard` hook
  - `dashboard` types
  - `firebase`
  - `loader.json`
  - `dataOptimizer` utils
  - `MetricCard` component (moved from shared to current directory)

### 2. DatePicker Type Fixes
- Changed onChange handlers from `(date) => ...` to `(date: Date | null) => date && ...`
- This fixes the TypeScript errors related to DatePicker expecting Date[] when selectsMultiple is used

### 3. Dashboard Component Export
- Added missing `export default Dashboard;` statement
- Added proper TypeScript types for props

### 4. Syntax Error
- The syntax error on line 1114 appears to have been in a different version of the file
- The current file doesn't contain the duplicate expression

### Remaining Potential Issues
Based on the error log, there might still be some type-related issues with ExtendedDashboardData expecting properties that aren't defined in the base DashboardData interface. These properties include:
- `role` property access in SalesAgentDashboard
- `performance` property structure

### Next Steps
1. Run `npm run build` to check if all errors are resolved
2. If there are still type errors, they'll likely be related to the data structure expectations
3. The application should now compile without the major syntax and import errors
